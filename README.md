# FizzBuzz in Go

A simple kata to learn the basics of Go for my final project at Makers Academy. 

#### The Kata

Write a method which prints out a list of positive integers, replacing the number with

* "Fizz" if the number is a multiple of 3;
* "Buzz" if the number is a multiple of 5;
* or "FizzBuzz" if the number is a multiple of 3 and 5.

#### The Approach

* TDD
* Using the Go documentation for syntax
